        <article>
            <p>With the introduction of ChatGPT alot of people who would have never heard about the advancements in Text Generation models now are more aware of it, lots of people now are using these models to take care of the hassle of having to write stuff <em>as we all can admit that writing is not fun</em>.</p>
<p>But I think that these models are far from good as I will explain now, ChatGPT which is just a GPT-3 model with the capacity to have dialogue can be very overly confident even when spewing the most made-up and unfactual responses you can imagine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first get one thing out of the way, Language models do not really understand language as we may think they are just trained to generate the <strong>most likely</strong> completion to a sequence of words and this results in the responses made by an <strong>LLM (Large Language Model)</strong> being unverifiable and most the time incorrect.</p>
<p>This is because the model is not aware of the context in which it is being asked a question and it is not aware of the world around it, it only has access to the training data it has seen and it is not aware of any facts or knowledge that it has not seen before.</p>
<p>Now the introduction of ChatGPT tried to remedy at least the problem of the context of the conversation and it&rsquo;s doing a decent job at it, as it can hold conversation quite well, but still it is not without its faults.</p>
<p>The model still has a lot of the same issues as before and it is still quite easy to get it to generate nonsensical responses, especially if you start the conversation with a non-sensical statement, this is because the model only has access to the conversation it has seen before, it has no external knowledge or facts to check.</p>
<p>Now this become quite ridiculous especially in the examples provided in the following <a href="https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2302.03494/">article</a> where it can sometime fails on even the most basic of tasks such as arithmetics, logic and reasoning.</p>
<p>Now one other thing to point is the fact that GPT based models especially is outrageously biased and this mostly due to multiple reasons including the fact that the training data already have bias baked into it since those LLMs are usually trained on Internet data written by internet users which are as we know are not the most objective of people, and also the failed attempts by OpenAI to combatting those biases by introducing even more bias in the form of &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; filters which can result in the model responding in weird and unexpected ways to certain topics and which if anything just made the model even more biased.</p>
<p>This is why I think that the hype behind ChatGPT or GPT-3 are blown out of porportions and I think that one should be very careful when trying to use them for something that requires being factually correct, now let&rsquo;s sit back and wait for what OpenAI is cooking with the GPT-4 which has been announced and will be released sometime around this year.</p>
